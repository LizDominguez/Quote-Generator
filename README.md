The inspiration for my first project was a speech by Melania Trump, during which she quoted Michelle Obama. 
It is a satire and does not reflect my political opinion.

Features:
* A button that generates new quotes/lyrics when clicked
* A button that tweets the quote on the screen with credit to original author
